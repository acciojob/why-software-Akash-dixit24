		Why I want to become a developer?
	</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I love the combination of logic and creativity that coding offers. Every project is like a puzzle that challenges me to think critically, find efficient solutions, and continuously learn new technologies. I’m passionate about building software that can make a real-world impact, whether it’s improving user experience, automating tasks, or creating innovative products. Becoming a developer gives me the opportunity to grow continuously and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology </p>
